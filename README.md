# Computation of Mobile Phone Collaborative Embedded Devices for Object Detection Task

- A pipeline method for collaborative computing between smartphones and embedded devices is proposed, which can optimize the model inference effect in embedded devices;
- Formulated reasonable design standards for pipeline schemes, extracted key factors for pipeline realization, and formulated reasonable pipeline design schemes based on these factors;
- The proposed pipeline scheme can be applied to many similar scenarios. Through the interaction between mobile phones and embedded devices, it can give users a better experience.



## Comming soon

- [ ] Pipeline scheme1
- [ ] Pipeline scheme 3
- [ ] Pipeline scheme 4
- [ ] With other communication methods



## Set Envirionment

- Linux ubuntu 16.04

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Android 18+

  

## Others

Currently we only provide a demo of Wi-Fi communication pipeline solution 2, other solutions and communication methods will come soon.
